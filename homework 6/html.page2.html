    <title>Old Man Coyote</title>
    <summary>Trickster and transformer, powerful and vulnerable, Coyote is a complex
        figure in Indian legend. He was often the ultimate example of how not to be:
        foolish, proud, self-important. The tales in Old Man Coyote were told by the
        Crow Indians of present-day southeastern Montana. During long winter evenings
        by the lodge fire, they enjoyed hearing about the only warrior ever to visit
        the Bird Country, the Little-people who adopted a lost boy, the two-faced tribe
        that gambled for keeps, the marriage of Worm-face, and the origin of the buffalo.
        Wandering through these well-spun tales is the irrepressible Old Man Coyote,
        sometimes scoring a coup, sometimes getting his comeuppance.</summary>
